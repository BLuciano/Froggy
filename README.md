I had created a similar version on Java for a school project but I wanted to recreate this for the web.
The reason being was to get a better understanding of events and animations with Javascript and DOM manipulation. Not only that, but also to further my HTML And CSS skills. 
The most challenging part I believe was getting the elements to display as needed with CSS and HTML and creating the animations for them.
